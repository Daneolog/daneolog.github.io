  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <h3>The challenge</h3>

  <p>It's impossible to not get caught up in the excitement of Atlanta's sports scene. With six professional sports
    franchises, high-performing collegiate teams, and top-notch venues â€“ we strive to build technology sports
    solutions.</p>
  Our goal is to address the following areas:

  <ul>
    <li>Athletic performance - wearables, data collection, performance analytics, optimization, injury prevention,
      apparel, equipment, talent evaluation</li>
    <li>Fan engagement - in-game engagement, deepen relationships/segmentation, communications, sales</li>
    <li>Operations - ticketing, game-day operations, parking, security, concessions, managing crowds entering and
      leaving
      the stadium, venue management</li>
    <li>Awards Program - loyalty and rewards program for attending and supporting sport events.</li>
    <li>Recruiting - a platform to find and evaluate sports talent to help recruit the best and brightest athletes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>The solution</h3>

  <p>Comprehensive SaaS (Software as a Service) solution to improve the fan experience with a new state-of-the-art
    stadium.</p>

  <p>For example, the entry experience. We will provide a device that could improve the speed and quality of stadium
    ingress, allowing greeters to shift their focus from scanning tickets to welcoming fans, as well as capture data to
    inform future developments, like a fan loyalty program.
    To address this need, we will develop a self-service ticket reading device that is flexible, mobile, wireless, and
    battery operated, as well as a robust backend web and database infrastructure with the ability to communicate in
    real
    time with existing ticketing services, such as Ticketmaster.</p>
